Add sounds:

pops to the other UI




sound on an off button



Hold Preview on Each Level
-expands view so that person can see view
- maybe option to play level or to go back



BUGS:






Fixed:

1. in the rare case that the level set has 6 or more words that can be made from quartiles...
- make it so that appending to the quartilelist only takes in the intended words...

2. We leaving the view and comming back with all quartiles found, the view resets and the user can still gain the additional 40 pts...
- Add a check in the Level class...

3. Changes Color when >= 100

4. Change tier names
